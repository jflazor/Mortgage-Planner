                <h3>The Power of Extra Payments</h3>
                <p>One of the most effective ways to save money is by making extra principal payments. Because interest is calculated on your remaining balance, every dollar you pay down early reduces the interest charged for every single month thereafter.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Round Up:</strong> Rounding your payment up to the nearest $100 can shave years off your loan.</li>
                    <li><strong>The "13th Payment":</strong> Making one extra full payment per year can reduce a 30-year mortgage to roughly 22-23 years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recasting:</strong> If you come into a lump sum (like a bonus), apply it as a "One-Time Payment" in this calculator to see how it impacts your timeline.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What is PMI and when does it go away?</h3>
                <p>PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) is usually required if you put down less than 20%. It protects the lender, not you. This tool automatically calculates your loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and highlights the specific month your PMI is removed on the schedule.</p>
                
                <h3>How do Annual Tax and HOA increases affect me?</h3>
                <p>Unlike a fixed principal & interest payment, taxes and fees rise over time. Most calculators ignore this, but it can make a home unaffordable in 10 years. Use the Advanced Options to <strong>calculate the impact of HOA fee increase on mortgage</strong> payments to ensure you remain within budget long-term.</p>
                
                <h3>Should I pay off my mortgage or invest?</h3>
                <p>This depends on your interest rate versus expected investment returns. If your mortgage rate is 7% and the market returns 5%, paying off the debt is a guaranteed 7% return. Use this tool to see exactly how much interest you save by paying early.</p>
